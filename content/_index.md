Hello, I'm Nikolas a junior software engineer from Munich - Germany. 
This is my personal website build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a 
slightly modified version of the [risotto](https://risotto.joeroe.io/) theme.
It is hosted on GitHub pages and updated using GitHub Actions.

After finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at LMU Munich, 
I realized that there are still many topics for me to explore. 
I want to use this site to showcase some of the things that I have been privately working on.

My interests include, Linux, ...

I am currently employed as a **Junior Cloud DevOps Engineer** at Eviden.

Right now I am learning the Clojure programming language.
