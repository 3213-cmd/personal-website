Hello, I'm Nikolas a junior software engineer from Munich - Germany. 
This is my personal website. I may or may not use it to post some posts here some.

After finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science I realized that there are still many topics for me to explore. 
If the time allows it I want to use this site to showcase some of the things that I am interested in or have been privately working on.

There are many things which I still want to learn so it is hard to choose what to focus on. 
But right now I am spending my time learning the Clojure programming language and looking into ways to become a better developer.

I am currently employed as a **Junior Cloud DevOps Engineer** at Eviden.

Outside of programming I enjoy watching movies and reading books, I plan to publish some of my reviews here at a later date.
