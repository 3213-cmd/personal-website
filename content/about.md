This website is build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a 
slightly modified version of the [risotto](https://risotto.joeroe.io/) theme.
It is hosted on GitHub pages and updated using GitHub Actions whenever I push a change.
To write posts I use [Org mode for Emacs](https://orgmode.org) and [ox-hugi](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)

The CV I use is based on [Jakes's Resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume) with a few personal tweaks. 
A makefile is used to manually compile all four versions of the CV.
